I freshly defended my thesis at George Washington University, now I am a doctor in the field of Computational Fluid Dynamic with focus on reproducible research. I have a strong background in applied math and computer science, which have prepared me well for the challenges of my graduate research project. 
My research on simulating water flooding with solid body dynamic and two-phase fluid. I am excited to see where my studies and interests will take me in the future.

In my free time, I have a keen interest in quantitative finance, web3 technologies, contemporary art and running. 

I am currently based in Washington, DC but open for relocation.

Here are technologies I've been working with recently Python3, C++, Cloud Computing, OpenFoam, p5.js, CUDA
